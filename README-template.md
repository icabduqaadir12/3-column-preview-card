# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is my solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). It helped me practice responsive layouts using SCSS, Flexbox, and Grid.

## 🚀 Overview

### ✅ The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for their device screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## 🛠️ My process

### 🔧 Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- SCSS (Sass)
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- BEM naming convention
- Mobile-first workflow
- GitHub Pages for deployment

### 📚 What I learned

- How to combine **Flexbox** and **Grid** to create responsive layouts
- Using **BEM** methodology to structure SCSS cleanly
- Creating a **2-column layout on tablets** and **3-column layout on desktops**
- Reusing components with modifiers (e.g., `.card--sedans`, `.card--luxury`)
```

## 🔄 Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Practice adding subtle animations for button hover and card transitions
- Make components more reusable in a React/Next.js environment
- Enhance accessibility with focus states and ARIA support
